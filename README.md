# üòä Emotion Detection Using OpenCV and Deep Learning

## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection** project! This application harnesses the power of computer vision and deep learning to identify human emotions from images. By utilizing OpenCV for image processing and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow for model training, this tool offers an intuitive interface for users to classify emotions from facial expressions accurately.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Use a diverse dataset containing images of faces labeled with corresponding emotions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Process images using OpenCV to ensure they are suitable for model input.
- **Model Development**: Implement and compare multiple deep learning models:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using PyTorch
  - **Pre-trained models** with TensorFlow (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)
- **User Interface**: Develop a Python UI for users to upload images and receive emotion predictions.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert source, e.g., FER2013], containing a variety of facial expressions, including:

| Emotion         | Description                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Anger**        | Expressing anger or frustration                   |
| **Disgust**      | Showing disgust or disdain                         |
| **Fear**         | Exhibiting fear or anxiety                         |
| **Happy**        | Displaying happiness or joy                        |
| **Sad**          | Reflecting sadness or disappointment               |
| **Surprise**     | Showing surprise or shock                          |
